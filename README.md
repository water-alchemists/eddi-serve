# water-alchemists.github.io
frontend for eddi management

# startup
this is ideally used in github.io, but can be run from a basic apache server. It is entirely a frontend app, so no backend bootup script is needed.

# use
- you can signup however you like.
- to add an eddi, you can use "test-eddi" as the eddi id, and name it whatever you like.
- most of the pages can't be seen unless you claim an eddi.
